<div class="sidebar_right">
	<p>I wonder, what should be put here...</p>
	<p class="sep">&#10086</p>
	<p>Not sure what I should place here. I think short paragraphs would look
	quite nice, separated by some fleurons. If I get a site up one day,
	some program could generate a feed of text for his sidebar, e.g. recent
	event, posts, etc.</p>
	<p class="sep">&#10086</p>
	<p>I think I should push this document onto github. Would be fun to build
	a little webpage. On github pages perhaps... sounds like a good idea.</p>
	<p class="sep">&#10086</p>
	<p>If today I would have had set out to learn some HTML, CSS and a bit about
	paragraph decorations - I could call today a success. I was supposed to
	do other things though. But still, in the bigger picture of things, I think
	I will call today a success nevertheless.</p>

	<h1>Current Projects</h1>
	<p>Currently I am mostly learning how to write computer games,
	as my dream is to create video games for a living,
	and, as I have been told and totally agree, it is best to learn
	such craft through practice.</p>
	<h3>Games</h3>
	<p>I spend most of my free time (as of 2017-02-24)
	on <a href="https://github.com/mncookiesstudios/breakout42" target="blank">breakout42</a>
	which is a breakout clone, as the name suggests. Even though breakout is
	not something most people would call fancy, I am learning a lot about 2D
	graphics, realtime colission detection and colisison reaction.
	</p>
	<p>Another project I enjoyed working on very much, is a roguelike
	I called <a href="https://github.com/cofogo/votsod/releases" target="_blank">votsod</a>.
	I have put the project indefinitely on hold, and I would like to return
	to it some time, but I feel like I have learned quite a few things
	about tile maps and random level generation, and the purpose of this
	project was not necesserily to finish it from the beginning.</p>
	<p>While there are quite a lot of little things I've done, some of which
	even survived a premature HDD wipe, it would take way too much time to
	write about them all, considering their relative insignificance.</p>

	<h3>Other Software</h3>
	<p>Will fill this part some time later.</p>
